Hey there, my name is Jeremy Parson and I am an aspiring full stack developer.

<img class="jeremy-image" src="/assets/jeremy.jpg"/>

<p>
  I Recently completed the NJIT Full Stack Bootcamp where I learned about customer-focused user experience and safe and efficient back-end development with cybersecurity concerns. Constantly discovering new development technologies and experimenting with software architectures. Looking forward to utilizing my skills in a new work opportunity.

During my free time I like to work on personal projects such as games, websites, or any random ideas I find interesting. You can go checkout my projects <a href="/project">here</a>!
